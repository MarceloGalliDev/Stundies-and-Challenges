Stundies-and-Challenges
Study days and challenges

Beginning of my journey in the world of programming, first steps, first challenges and exercises.

Starting with a free Curso em VÃ­deo (by Gustavo Guanabara), I took over 200 classes, learning from scratch what HTML5 and CSS3 is. Link: https://www.cursoemvideo.com/

Later I started the great journey at Rocketseat, with a course called Discovery, and being part of the acceleration program called Explorer, where we seek to study for a Full-Stack. Link: https://www.rocketseat.com.br/

And I use this space as my evolution diary, demonstrating my skills and technical growth, soft skills, hard skills and community engagement.

Thanks
