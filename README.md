Stundies-and-Challenges
Study days and challenges

Beginning of my journey in the world of programming, first steps, first challenges and exercises.

Starting with a free Curso em Vídeo (by Gustavo Guanabara), I took over 200 classes, learning from scratch what HTML5 and CSS3 is. Link: https://www.cursoemvideo.com/

Posteriormente dei início a grande jornada na Rocketseat, com curso chamado de Discovery, e fazendo parte do programa de aceleração que se chama Explorer, onde buscamos estudar para um Full-Stack. Link: https://www.rocketseat.com.br/

And I use this space as my evolution diary, demonstrating my skills and technical growth, soft skills, hard skills and community engagement.

Thanks
